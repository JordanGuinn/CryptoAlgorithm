Welcome to Jason Dorn, and Jordan Guinn's cryptoalgorithm program for csc 650.

Our cryptoprogram will follow the following steps:
1) open a plain .txt file
2) read the file into the program
3) parse the first 128 bits
4) take the second 64 bits and put them infront of the initial 64 bits
5) encode the even spots to move up a letter, and odd to move down a letter
6) then go back to step 3 till EOF
